# asciibeautify

## MLH Hacky Birthday Event Contribution

This is a demo application hosted at [asciibeautify.com](https://asciibeautify.com) that
allows users to paste in ascii art and colorize it with a theme or custom color scheme. This is built using LitElement and web components. The ascii-beautify component will eventually be listed on npm as an installable web component package ascii-beautify.
